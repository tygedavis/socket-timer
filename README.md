I'm currently learning how to use WebSocket with React! It's super great!

I learned this particular code from this [Medium](https://medium.com/dailyjs/combining-react-with-socket-io-for-real-time-goodness-d26168429a34) article.

I did update the client side to use hooks but that's about the only change I've made so far. More to come as I continue learning WebSocket.
